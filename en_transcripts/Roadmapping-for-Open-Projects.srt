1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,690
Emmy Tsang: Okay, so roadmaps, I
think all of us have some

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,340
understanding of what it is so.
But let's forget about that for

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,990
a second. And let's, let's
rethink what we know, in the

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,070
next sort of 10 minutes or so.
So what we'll be doing, at the

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,240
end of this call, I believe,
we'll be asking you to create or

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,380
revise a roadmap for your
project. That's only for project

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,570
needs. That's not fundamentals
or other friends. But yeah, so

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,170
in the next 10 minutes, let's
discover how to use a roadmap to

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,450
plan our work and contribution
on open projects. And we'll also

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:49,470
look at some examples. So you're
mentioned that open leaders

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,010
design and build projects that
empower others to collaborate

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,150
within inclusive communities.
roadmapping is not only about

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,170
designing, but more importantly,
we'd like to focus on empowering

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,210
others to collaborate. So again,
going back to that open

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,520
leadership framework, which I
really suggest you have a look

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,690
at after this call on in your
own time as well. This

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,300
roadmapping is really a tool
that we should use in our design

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,730
processes to to build a project
that really facilitates

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,090
participation, and inclusion. So
this is really, you'll see that

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,560
coming through later, as well as
I break down the roadmap. This

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,490
is really about governance,
about how we make decisions

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,810
about how we want to welcome
people into our communities and

23
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,420
about project identity. So what
the project is.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,000
So

25
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,530
we want, the first step to allow
people to empower people to

26
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,550
collaborate with us in building
our projects is really to create

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,700
welcoming spaces. So I think
that we all want our projects to

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,750
be welcoming spaces. And to do
that, there's a couple of like

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,490
tips here you can see, so make a
good first impression. So that

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,860
your contributors and yourself,
you know that you're in the

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,870
right place, explain how
contributors can get involved in

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,160
your project. And then also, if
you think about it, it's really

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,460
helpful for people to know
what's happening at this point,

34
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,370
and what's coming next. So,
these are, these are kind of the

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,850
motivations to include these
three different components

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,940
within the roadmap. So we're
going to go through them one by

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,120
one in the next slides. But
first, this project summary and

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,630
welcome then how to get
involved. And then the timeline.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
project summary, and welcome.
It's really important because a

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,750
lot of people get directed to
your roadmap, without you know,

41
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,900
any contacts or any prior
understandings, you really have

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,390
to assume that they maybe know
nothing about your project

43
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,620
beforehand. So I think it's
important that we welcome and

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,730
help orient our visitors so that
they understand where they are,

45
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,650
is often nice to have a project
summary, for example, to say,

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,350
you know, two, three sentences
of what your project is about.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,060
And this also helps give a very
clear focus for ourselves when

48
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,490
you're writing the rest of the
roadmap. Oh, just one thing

49
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,550
before I moved on, yeah, you
might want to make that quite

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,520
welcoming in your own style, as
well. So you know, you can

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,940
put emojis, for example, that I
like, but you have your own choice. The next

52
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,970
part is how to get involved. So
new contributors may be very

53
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,670
enthusiastic, and they may want
to jump right in. But it doesn't

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,540
mean that they know how to. So
it's really important that we

55
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,090
point to parts of the project
that they can immediately work

56
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,750
on. And then also point to
documentation and pages that can

57
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,950
help them check out you know,
what's, what's happening and how

58
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:11,580
they can contribute. And then
finally, we get to the timeline.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,670
So that's really, yeah, the star
of a roadmap. So the timeline is

60
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,930
there to help us organize as
project leaders to organize our

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,550
tasks to complete our projects
around the milestones that we

62
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,420
will learn to set. And then also
to map what we're working on now

63
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,140
and what's going to happen next.
And you can imagine that if that

64
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,570
helps you organize things, and
it also helps you contribute or

65
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:43,320
understands how your projects
work timewise. So, milestones,

66
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,820
they are significant turning
points or events that will help

67
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,740
move the project forwards. So
typically, these are - there could

68
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,370
be many types of milestones, but
typically they are like status

69
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,260
goals. So for example, an MVP so
a minimal viable That's like a

70
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,500
first release of your projects
or software or open book,

71
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,980
whatever you're working on.
These could be dates and events.

72
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,880
So it may be you are taking your
project to an open hackathon,

73
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,130
you may want to put that down,
because a lot of work will be

74
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,030
done during around that date in
that event. They could also be

75
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,850
timeframes. So that could be,
you know, short term goals

76
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,690
medium term. So maybe depends on
what you're trying to achieve,

77
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,660
but maybe what's going to happen
two or three months down the

78
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,690
line, and then what's going to
what you hope to see in the

79
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,100
year, let's say, so, you can
think about this for your own

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,830
projects, discuss this with your
mentor, and pick 1-2-3 milestones

81
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,220
for your timeline. And then once
you have those milestones, it

82
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,260
then makes it easier to break
things down even more. So to

83
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,960
achieve each of those
milestones, it's good to think

84
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,130
about what tasks needs to be
completed. So you can line these

85
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,250
up chronologically, or just
think about the stuff that needs

86
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,810
to happen, when those master
facilitate those milestones

87
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,160
happening. include information
with each of the tasks, so to

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,690
make it easier for contributors.
So for example, what needs to be

89
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,240
done pointers as to how you can
get started, or the reason why

90
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,990
those tasks exists. And those
should reinforce your vision.

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,600
So that was a very fast overview
of the components of a roadmap,

92
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,640
how do we make this open, and
that's very much determined by

93
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,020
also how you start the roadmap.
So you can store it in a

94
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,590
separate file. So if your folks
are familiar already with like

95
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,810
GitHub and or gitlab, or one of
these open project platforms,

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,590
then you may be familiar with
like markdown format. So you can

97
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,210
have a file called roadmap doc
and MD, and you will, you can

98
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,410
put your roadmap there, you can
put it in a README file, again,

99
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,050
that's the introduction page
that you get in these open

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,790
repositories. You can put it in
an issue. Again, that's that's

101
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,480
referring to GitHub
infrastructure. I'll show you an

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,000
example in a bit and, or in the
Projects tab in GitHub, so many,

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,890
many ways that the idea is that
you drop this and you try to

104
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,440
make this openly available to
everyone who wants to look at

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,290
it. And also allow them to maybe
give you feedback or, or

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,370
comments on your work as well.
So let's look at one example.

107
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,110
This was very nicely done,
I think when OLS1 happened

108
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,830
That's the
roadmap for collecting

109
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,240
applications for less. So you
can see at the top is what is

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,410
all asked, Why are you like, if
you have no idea what all of

111
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,200
this is, at least the first
sentence will let you know that

112
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,010
open lifesciences and mentoring
and training program, and then

113
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,540
how to get involved. And then a
very detailed timeline with a

114
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,620
major milestone. So before open
applications, when applications

115
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,320
open when applications are
closed, and then the task in

116
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,050
between. So this is done in a
GitHub issue, as we can see

117
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:30,090
here. And yeah, that's what can
look like in real life. So there

118
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,580
are other examples on the slides
as well if you access the slides

119
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,220
later, and you can click into
them and check them out in more

120
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:43,500
detail. That's that. So yeah, we
hope that you know, this is an

121
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,590
introduction to empowering you
as a project leader, you already

122
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,790
have a lot of skills to be a
leader, but maybe we can help

123
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,360
each other do is to become more
open and open leaders and open

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360
science ambassadors. So think
about what you'd like to achieve

125
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,030
and break that down and turn
that into a roadmap.
