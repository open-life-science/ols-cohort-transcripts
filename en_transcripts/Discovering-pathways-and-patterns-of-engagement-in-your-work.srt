00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Emmy Tsang: Mountains of
engagement, this technique is

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,140
introduced to me by our very own
Malvika. And I've since used it

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,350
at least five to six times
incredibly helpful for me to

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,440
structure my thinking around
community engagement and

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,550
pathways that Anelda also
mentioned already. So I hope and

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,710
I think we're all aware of this
kind of management levels

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,860
within, you know, your typical
organization, you have members

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,830
and leaders with different
responsibilities and tasks, and

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,400
delegations and completion. And
there are also opportunities for

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,360
people to be get appraisals, to
get promoted to have more

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,760
leadership ability and feel
recognized for the work.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,170
Similarly, you can imagine in
the community, this type of

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,910
structure do exists implicitly
or explicitly. And so it is

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,760
important for us to think a
little bit about, you know, how

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,900
people interact within your
community, the organization, the

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,200
project and its culture,
discover how people can move

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,660
between different types of
interactions and develop

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,660
pathways for people to move from
sort of first contact, which is

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,220
the lower level of engagement to
sustained engagement to

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,900
leadership. So, speeding through
this, you can construct your

21
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,250
mountain of engagement in five
steps, you start with a list of

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,800
all the people's interactions in
your work, this could be things

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,760
like, you know, following you on
Twitter, to writing a blog post

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,060
for your project, attending a
community call, list everything,

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,410
and then try and create bands of
engagement. So think about, you

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,650
know, whether how much time or
how much effort this takes how

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,100
engaged they are
correspondingly. And then group

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,980
these interactions into your
bands, and then give each of

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,280
them a name. So it could be like
first contact or sustained

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,240
participation to like the top
level five, there usually is

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,900
leadership. And then look at how
folks are moving between these

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,830
different levels, identify what
works and what doesn't work,

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,590
this is going to be a lot the
longest process, once you've

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,160
sort of, I would say it never
ends. Basically, once you've

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,280
constructed your mountain, you
constantly need to be asking

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,630
your community and you know,
sort of getting a sense of how

37
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,720
you can modify these so that
people can actually effectively

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,250
climb up the mountain, and use
that insight to prioritize your

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,610
work to create more
opportunities. So as I said,

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,520
I've gone through this really,
really quickly. The rest of this

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,890
slide deck has a lot of
questions that you can use to

42
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,140
ask yourself and your community.
So basically, do more of that

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,200
step four, and step five type of
work. But that's the gist. I

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,760
hope I give you a quick overview
of what's happening here. And

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,130
was this technique and was
useful for and if you have

46
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,680
further questions, you know,
please approach any of us

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,550
Malvika, Yo, Bernice and myself,
and probably others in the

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,570
cohort as well. And we're all
familiar with this technique.

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,270
Some sense. So I'm handing over
to Bernice to talk about

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,700
welcoming new contributors to
projects.

51
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,579
Bernice: Okay, thanks. So I will 
be also try to be short. So

52
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,089
yeah, it's more a practical way
how you can welcome new

53
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:20,129
contributors and engage them and
empower them in your project. So

54
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:26,129
I will share some things. So and
then we're going to discuss

55
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,219
about the pathway here is
more on the mentorship side. So

56
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:36,239
you can monitor your
contributors to build the

57
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,049
pathways through their roles
through your project, from the

58
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:47,339
first interaction to
leadership's what sorry. So

59
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:51,299
first things is how you attract
contributors. So you created

60
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,169
pathways, but also, you can also
you need to document your

61
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,189
project to learn about README,
CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

62
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,789
LICENSE.md and roadmap are
really good to have particular

63
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,959
things you need to add to your
project. One of the things that

64
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,199
is really helpful to attract
contributors is to create small

65
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,739
tutorials on how to contribute
to your projects, lab value

66
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,319
issues on your GitHub
repository, share with GitHub or

67
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,989
GitLab repository or any other
to say which which issue 

68
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,949
could be easily solved by new
contributors. So you can like

69
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:30,419
label them newcomer friendly, I
pointed first timer only

70
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:37,079
to be sure that this
issue are done by people that

71
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,729
are not are not so much familiar
with your project. Another thing

72
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,669
that is really helpful is to
organize collaboration events,

73
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,359
so or co-fest where other people
can come and learn how to

74
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,719
contribute to your project and
they they have people that can

75
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:57,959
help them there. Then what is
good also is to when you have

76
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,169
new contributions is monitoring
your contributers. So when

77
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,129
your new contributor comes,
there needs to it's good that

78
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,339
they have support on how to get
started, where to find the end

79
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,109
of clear requirements in each of
the issues. What are the

80
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:16,049
requirements for solving these
issues and point through

81
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,629
relevant information when
needed, so contributing

82
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:23,429
guidelines and others. And so
when a new contributor arrives,

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,689
it's really great if you could
welcome them and point to these

84
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,499
resources. So either you do it
manually for each of the

85
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,679
contribution, but you have also
some welcome-bots that you can

86
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,269
link to your GitHub repository
that could point that

87
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:44,009
automatically to the people. And
one of the things that is make

88
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,609
the commitment to respond to
inquiries, so it requires times,

89
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:52,229
but it's helpful for the people
that are not feeling that they

90
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,599
are doing the work for nothing.
And once they're contributed or

91
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,499
submitting pull requests, in
GitHub, thank them

92
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:04,949
for their work, because they did
something. And they take the

93
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,479
time to learn how to do that.
And it's really, yeah, I think

94
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,779
it's the most important things
give good, consistent and

95
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,809
helpful feedback during the
review. So both good. Positive

96
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,559
also, and also sometimes the
negative feedbacks is also

97
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:26,099
important. Ask questions about
what they have done guide them,

98
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:30,869
Highlight their work on your project.
So put them on GitHub or social

99
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:34,589
media, have a list of
contributors is also useful when

100
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:37,949
you way you can highlight the
contributors, even if it's just

101
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,019
fixing a small issue, there's
more I mean, small mistakes or

102
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:49,439
small out to say, yeah, small
things, point them to a good

103
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:54,389
next issue task that they can do
for the that they can become

104
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,569
more and more. They can you can
empower them. And then you have

105
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,139
you can go to the next step. So
continuing moderation, so you

106
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,619
can continue, you can improve on
more and more your contributors.

107
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,159
So being available, what are the
time they

108
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:15,269
want to use to contribute, 
you need to learn from

109
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,109
them that I will not go through
the details here because we are

110
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:22,499
really short in time, but you
have the detail there about what

111
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:27,659
you can do. provide ongoing
support. So monitor any channel

112
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:31,289
or channel that you have
uncertain any newcomers

113
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,319
questions, provide guidance and
guidelines connect people with

114
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,859
other members, because you are
not the only one that can guide

115
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:40,829
them or mentor them. There is
other contributors in your

116
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:45,089
project fully, and then they can
help others and organize really,

117
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:48,839
community events that are really
greatly great welcome.

118
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,229
supporting multiple new
contributors, for me, was really

119
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,619
the main things that I learned
from the different projects I'm

120
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,279
involved in.

121
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,460
establish clear expectations
pathway and, and personally, I

122
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,610
think it's a really great,
communicate regularly. So give

123
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,600
feedback to the to your
contributors. And, and yeah,

124
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,110
involve them also in in
different in the different

125
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,470
decisions that can be taken,
provides structure through the

126
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,490
review process and encourage them
and provide or 

127
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,710
give them some more and more
leadership's roles and model best

128
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,210
practices. And there are some
questions. So either an issue

129
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,690
you can start monitoring today.
And do you need to set up a chat

130
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,960
channel or something where other
people could ask that question?

131
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,520
And should you model any of your
current contributors to take

132
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,810
more roles in your project? It
was really quick, but I think

133
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,930
you can learn a lot. I mean,
it's really it was really

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,340
helpful for me for my projects
to to to use to apply these

135
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,140
practices this small trick there
and get more people there.

136
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,960
Thanks.Emmy,

137
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,760
yeah. Thank you very much. Bernice
Yeah, sorry, 

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,540
folks. Lots to digest. And
I'm also we're also one minute

139
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,170
over the hour already. So if you
need to log off, please do now.

140
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,300
We have a couple of assignments
for you one of them mentioned

141
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,060
already by Anelda. There are
you know, if you can complete

142
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,120
some personas and pathways,
ideally with your community

143
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,630
together, then that will be
awesome. Fantastic. If not, you

144
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,350
know, I guess the most important
thing actually, we'd like you to

145
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,280
do is to think about your
presentations and graduation. We

146
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,980
have next week three rehearsal
calls, I think Tuesday,

147
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,760
Wednesday and Thursday. The
Times are in the calendar. you

148
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,930
need you need to I think put
your name down for one of them.

149
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,670
Check your email. Thank you.
Well, you can check your emails

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,970
for further instructions and
details. If anything is on

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,080
Clear, just give us a shout on
lots to read from this

152
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
call. So I hope you can, you
know, take the time to do it.

153
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,480
And again, we're here. So let us
know if you have any questions

154
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,400
or if there's any thoughts and
comments that you'd like to

155
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,620
share after. All right. Thank
you. Um, hope to see you all

156
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,430
next week. Thank you so much to
our guest speakers and everyone

157
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,000
for attending.
