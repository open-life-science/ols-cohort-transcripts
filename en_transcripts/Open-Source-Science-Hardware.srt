00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Andre Maia Chagas: Without hardware
without equipment, there is no

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,910
science in a way, right? We
can download all these amazing

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,970
data sets. But if you really
want to be in control of

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,440
generating data and answering
so exciting questions locally,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,620
and questions that are important
for your science and your

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,650
community, let's say, then you
need the proper tools to do it,

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,210
right? Malik already introduced
me, but Hello from my side. So

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,330
that I get started: I work at
University of Sussex, where I

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,270
have a job that I
really, really like, which is

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,150
developing open source hardware,
for the Department of

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,780
neurosciences. I'm also
volunteering a lot of my time to

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,860
train in Africa, which is an
NGO trying to help development

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,210
in higher education in Africa.
So we do a lot of sharing of our

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,600
knowledge so that people can
actually build their own tools,

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,750
we do a lot of workshops. I
started a small website called

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,450
Open neuroscience. And I'm
working with Juliette Arancio, and

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,480
Alex kutscheray, as part of the
Convention on this program.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,820
It's similar to open Life
Sciences, but for hardware,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,740
called Open hardware makers. All
of this started about... I mean, I

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,890
think I have already spoken about
why open hardware, right?

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,670
We need hardware to do the
experiments, the things that we

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,020
do. Here's just one example
in life sciences. If

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,280
you are thinking about
microscopes, which is one of the

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,170
workhorses inside Life Sciences,
right? These tools are from, they

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,070
were first developed, in
the late 1600s, I think, if I'm

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,640
not mistaken. This one that
you see on the left is actually

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,820
from 19.., the turn of the 20th
century. 1904, or something,

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,610
and the one on the right is a
little bit more recent. As you

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,340
can see, the modern
microscope didn't change much

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,370
over the last 100 years. And
still, if you want to get one on

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,100
the right, you would spend
something like 10,000 pounds.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,380
I mentioned costs,
because although we really like

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,630
to romanticize things about
science in the end, we
,
34
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,080
still need to pay for things.
Things are really

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,020
expensive, although the
technology in them didn't change

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,290
much over the last 100 years.
There is something

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,890
wrong there from my perspective.
But even if you don't consider

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,560
that, if you think about you
are, let's say, in the global

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,930
South, where I'm originally from,
trying to buy a microscope, you

40
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,390
only find distributors from the
global north. So you have to

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,050
import things, they only have
that, or they mostly have their

42
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,380
clients in the global north.
So if I bring it back to

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,440
my hometown, in Brazil, where it
was super hot, warm and humid,

44
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,740
then the fingers are gonna,
rest really fast and

45
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,120
probably be out of work. If it
breaks, I have no local support,

46
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,120
I have no idea what's going on
inside because it's a

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,390
black box. And as COVID-19 has
shown us, our supply chains, for

48
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,200
equipment, for consumables,
 they are really

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,310
fragile, right? Once
there is a disruption from

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,680
China and so on, everybody
gets stalled, and things get

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,760
delayed, and so on. And so all
of this together makes

52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,570
scientific equipment really slow
to innovate, right? Because you

53
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,870
cannot open ... I'm not gonna
fiddle around with a 10,000

54
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,930
pounds piece of equipment, right?
If I break it, the

55
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,260
whole department is gonna want
my head. So, I better not

56
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,490
fool around with that, right?
And so this is why without

57
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,550
access to these tools, proper
access, there is no science,

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,640
right? And this is where open
source comes in. This is just a

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,720
few examples of open source
microscopes. They're available

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,650
today, if you want to find these
projects online, you

61
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,410
could find and reproduce them
right away. And the nice thing

62
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,100
about them is that

63
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,960
all of them are under $100.
Some maybe Actually...

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,110
let's say all of them were under
$200, which is orders of

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,280
magnitude cheaper than the ones
that I just showed you. And

66
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,700
they're all portable.
Here on the left, you have the

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,830
scale view, which is about five
centimeters. This is something

68
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,610
we developed in the lab a long
time ago. And we're using for

69
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,030
educational purposes and so on.
But you could do 80% of the

70
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,460
stuff that you do in the labs,
right? This one next to it is

71
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,520
actually very specialized for
fluorescence, which is a

72
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,040
fancy method in
life sciences. But the one that

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,460
I would like to highlight is
this one, the one left, with

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,710
the yellow one, which is called
open fracture, which is an

75
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,520
amazing project that I really
like. I'm not involved with the

76
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,580
project myself, but I really
like the project because

77
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,020
they're actually made the papers
and prove that this actually is

78
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,640
able to detect malaria inside
blood cells. So the resolution

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,210
of this is on par with optical
microscopes. And you can build

80
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,300
it for a fraction of the cost
and 3d print parts wherever you

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,900
are actually. A lot of the
developers for design 

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,400
are partner developers with
the people here in Bath which is

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,540
close by To Brighton where I am. And
the other microscope on the

84
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,680
right is actually about this big
and goes on the head of mice,

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,150
and they can actually do live
imaging of brain activity while

86
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,130
the animals are performing a
certain task. And what I think

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,250
is really crucial about these
two examples, these last two setups

88
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,920
is that the yellow one
"open fracture", they actually

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,960
showed that they can do better
or like the same or better

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,900
performance than actual
commercially available

91
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,630
microscopes. And the one on the
right, [...]

92
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,400
which is the miniscope project,
can actually provide something

93
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
that wasn't available before. So
before the miniscope, as an open

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,020
project came along, there was no
way to have freely moving mice

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,880
and record their like brain
activity with optical imaging.

96
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,830
This brings a lot
of innovation, there is a big

97
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,330
community around miniscope, just
to pound on the point that

98
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,900
the speakers that came before me
said that fostering a community

99
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
and bringing people into an open
project actually is good for

100
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,010
research is good for you. And
it's good for innovation and

101
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,650
speeding up the cycles and
science and research. I

102
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,960
wanted to keep this kind of
short. So this is just a slide

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,040
that Uli made. And I adapted
to show why we should use open

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,980
hardware. And I hope I have
mentioned this already, even if

105
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,900
too fast, and giving you a
lot of information. But let's

106
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,810
take again, step by step.
So because it's reproducible.

107
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,500
we actually use GitHub and
GitHub a lot to put out our

108
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,190
projects, our open hardware
projects, because it's actually

109
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,430
super fun to learn how somebody
did something, like  how the

110
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,100
miniscope, this amazing project,
works, right, I can go into the

111
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,950
documentation, and actually see
how they put the boards

112
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,100
together, how the electronics
work, and so on. It's super

113
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,090
affordable. So from our
experience with people that are

114
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,900
being part of our workshops in
Africa, they say: look, this is

115
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,950
affordable enough that here in
our institution, we can

116
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,620
pull some resources together and
get started with open source

117
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,160
hardware. It's repairable
because I know like everything

118
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,180
that is going on. Inside the
hardware, I can also know how to

119
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,820
repair it when something goes
wrong. But not even that,

120
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,490
because I know how everything
works. I also know if the data

121
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,390
that I get out of it is reliable
or not. Right? Like, Oh, is this

122
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,140
PCR? Or is this image from this
microscope Really like it is

123
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,110
supposed to be or is it an
artifact? Right? Because I know

124
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,660
how it works, then I know the
limitations and the

125
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,270
capabilities. And because I know
the limitations and

126
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,600
capabilities, I know where and
how, and if I need to customize

127
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,980
something, right? So let's say
I'm using the open flexor for

128
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,550
something, but right now it
works on power in the in the

129
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,910
wall socket. But I need it
with batteries. Because I know

130
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,180
how it works, I can easily
say:xd okay, if I change this power

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,000
supply with this batteries, then
I can actually bring this to the

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,140
fields and use it outside the
lab space or even in a lab where

133
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,480
there are constant power
failures, right? And putting all

134
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,360
of this together This is then
obviously, hopefully, if it's

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,260
done, right, it's democratizing,
right? Because then it doesn't

136
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,470
matter if you are in the global
north, or if you're doing

137
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,490
citizen science, or if you are
inside academia, because you're

138
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,150
collecting data with tools that
you actually know exactly what

139
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,180
they're doing. You can go and
say, Look, this is my data. This

140
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,410
was how it was recorded. And it's,
 good data, right? So

141
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,160
we need to discuss data and not
whether or not like I have a

142
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,470
$10,000 piece of microscope.

143
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,080
Luckily for us, there is what
I'm calling, the Cambrian

144
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,140
explosion of open source
hardware going on. So what

145
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,080
you're seeing here are a lot of
projects that are currently

146
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,110
available. some highlights that
I think are really cool, like

147
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,860
here on the top left, you can
see this little object on the on

148
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,310
the palm of our hand, this is an
atomic force microscope.

149
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,030
So this goes down to image like
really, really, really tiny

150
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,770
stuff. Right? So it really
measures like nanometers and

151
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,850
things that are really small.
Then here, on the bottom row,

152
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,360
you can see the the image where
there is somebody holding a

153
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,900
little whiteboard, this is
actually an EKG machine. And

154
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,180
this person actually discovered
that - he writes a blog

155
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,430
post, and I can find the
reference later if somebody

156
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,350
wants- But he actually finds
that he has a heart arrhythmia,

157
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,760
because he was able to play
around with this EKG and brought

158
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,460
it to his doctor and said, Look,
this is my data. This is how my

159
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,540
heart looks like over a 24/24
hour period. And there is

160
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,910
something wrong here. Let's fix
it right. And it could have been

161
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,210
that he would never like know
about this. But I think it's

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,880
interesting that people have the
empowerment to know what's

163
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,970
going on with them. But on this
note, there is also a project

164
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,680
that is called Open insulin
where people are actually making

165
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,850
insulin monitors and trying to
make their own insulin because

166
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,480
like price seringe of insulin in
the US right now. For instance,

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,660
like crazy, and a lot of people
are really having bad times

168
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,410
managing to get their hands on
the proper insulin that they

169
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,350
need, and so on. And so this
also empowers people to say, you

170
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,810
know what, we are not
going to take this nonsense

171
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,650
anymore. And we're going to do
it our own way. And there are

172
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,470
many, many other projects,
 just a little bit of data

173
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,290
on something that we're working
on at the moment, which is, this

174
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,680
is something that we're working
with just to show you that what

175
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,830
we're seeing here is the number
like the fraction of papers, as

176
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,500
a percentage of total
publications from Pubmed,

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,290
over time, from the 1990s to
2020, of papers that had either

178
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,980
open source hardware, open
hardware, or open lab were in

179
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,420
their abstract title, or
keywords. Right, so you can see

180
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,810
that this is growing. I
mean, it's still a tiny, tiny

181
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,810
fraction of the total number of
papers, of course, but what I

182
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,520
like here is how fast new
papers are coming more and more

183
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,800
each year. If people are
interested in this, I would

184
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,980
really recommend taking a look
at the GOSH community, which is

185
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,070
the global Open Science hardware
community, which is mainly where

186
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,940
Uli, Alex and I met. But the
point that I'd like to make here

187
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,360
is that this is a really, really
global online community, most of

188
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,450
the time, where people really
from all continents are

189
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,450
discussing open hardware,
they're really, really open to

190
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,650
newcomers and really willing to
help with questions. And there

191
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,140
is I think, the most important
document that was done

192
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,020
collectively, as you can see on
the photo, on the bottom, 

193
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,450
this was the voting for
things in the manifesto that we

194
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,520
wrote. What is the
point of the global open science

195
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,370
community and what is our
Manifesto? And you can

196
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,050
see the points highlighted here.
And this tries to make sure that

197
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,480
this still keeps going
as a really diverse and

198
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,240
horizontal community where
things are being discussed, and

199
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,400
all of these different
communities are being taken in

200
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,020
consideration. Again, I can
share the link for this, if I

201
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,590
did notice, here I have a slide
in the end with useful links,

202
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,190
this might be there. A little
bit of a shameless advert, I'm

203
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,750
sorry, so we are actually
finishing the curriculum for a

204
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,920
new program. And you can pre
register. So if you go to open

205
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,120
hardware dot space. And you can
also find more information about

206
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,180
this. The idea of this
program is to take people that

207
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,420
are newcomers into open hardware
and to show them best practices.

208
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,970
 So you're going to cover
a lot of things that are quite

209
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,120
similar in terms of like, Oh,
this is GitHub, or this is

210
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,930
Instructables. And these are all
these platforms. But also like

211
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,610
we're going to show like points
on documentation and licenses

212
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,490
and things because hardware,
believe it or not, most of

213
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,210
hardware projects need at least
three different licenses, which

214
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,890
is different from all the
projects that we've been

215
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,760
discussing right now. But yeah,
so I just wanted to say, please

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,400
take a look at the website, get
in touch, if you want, like will

217
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,900
be super, super happy to get
projects, or even just questions

218
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,840
from you. Because we are in the
moment where we're finalizing

219
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,660
our curriculum, and we're ready
to launch hopefully, in another

220
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,840
couple of months, and then still
run a cohort this year. With

221
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,270
that, I would like to say
thanks, you can ask me

222
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,330
questions. I think you're
writing hopefully, in the

223
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,780
document. You can find me on
Twitter, you can send me an

224
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,250
email as well. I'll be super
happy to chat. And just to say

225
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,760
that here's a list of what I
think are useful links.
