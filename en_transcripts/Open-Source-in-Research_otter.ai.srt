00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
Helena Rasche: My name is Helena Rasche
, I've been working in

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,130
open source for quite some time
now I'm currently employed by

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,620
the hospice Medical Center and
the Avans Hogeschool in

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,890
Breda. And I'm here to tell
you a little bit about open

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,270
source in research. So first,
what is free and open source

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,110
software, the term is a bit
important. Because open source

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,290
software and free software are
not necessarily the same things

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,490
free software doesn't mean open.
So you can many of us remember

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,550
freeware on the internet from
when we were younger. This is

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,830
software where you have no
access to source code and you

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,400
can't work with it, you can't
modify it due to license. This

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,120
is not great for science. On the
other hand, open source doesn't

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
mean free. So for those of you
who are producing research

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,310
software, just because you're
making your software open

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,900
source, it doesn't mean it has
to be free software. And this

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,110
together, the intersection of
these two is often known as free

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,680
and open source software, or
FOSS Free and open-source software

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
And this just
refers to software that's

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,750
both open and free. Open source
is simply licensing your work so

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,440
it can be used how you want.
Making your software, open

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,490
source is just a matter of
setting out the terms of how you

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,730
want your software to be used,
it doesn't mean that you have to

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,860
give up control of your
software, it doesn't mean that

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,680
you're putting it out to the
community forever. It just means

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,590
you're choosing and saying for
yourself setting boundaries on

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,830
how you want your software to be
used. So it's very important

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,150
step all the time. For those who
want you open source also makes

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,170
it easy for others to remix your
software to reuse it to build

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,860
upon your software, add new
features if they want. And if

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,130
you're building a project where
community is important, where

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,070
you want your software to be
used by a lot of people, making

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,860
it open source in such a way
that people can reuse and work

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,160
with you can be a really great
boost for your software just in

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,950
terms of visibility and people
who want to use it, things like

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,610
that. So why use and promote
open source. Open source is part

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,200
of the ethics of scientists and
hackers a little bit when you're

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,530
writing the software when you're
working on projects together. A

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,120
lot of the libraries you use for
Python, things like this, if

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,980
you're using different
programming languages, a lot of

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,190
Python libraries you use will be
open source, you're benefiting

41
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,940
from a lot of work that other
people have done so far. And

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,500
it's a nice feeling to
collaborate and give back. Now

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,360
you've built your software or
your project on years and years

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,630
of free work that was produced
before and now you're giving

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,980
back to the community. It also
means distributed innovation. So

46
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,970
when you're making software open
source and free so that other

47
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,580
people can work on it. This
means that other people will

48
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,850
give back contributions, they'll
report bugs, when they have

49
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,520
issues running your software,
they will tell you new features

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,640
that they want. You don't have
to implement them. But you're

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,760
able to take all of these good
ideas from the community and

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,540
things like this. Importantly,
for science, open source is

53
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,830
easier to review, reuse and
integrate. And when we talk

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,860
about open source in science, if
you want your software to be

55
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,220
distributed widely to be used in
a lot of systems, one of the

56
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,850
best things you can do for it is
licensing it in such a way that

57
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,880
everyone can use it and set it
up on their own system. Things

58
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,240
like Galaxy so I'm of course
very biased here, and we'll talk

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,980
a lot about Galaxy. But in the
Galaxy community, we can give a

60
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,910
huge platform of you know,
unused Galaxy, you 30,000 users

61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,570
to free source, it's free
advertising. But we can only do

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,260
that for open source software.
There are a lot of risks

63
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,830
associated with closed code to
when you have closed source

64
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,460
software that's used in science,
you can't review it very easily,

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,310
the community can't review it
very easily only the reviewers

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,670
of the paper sometimes. And if
there are errors in the

67
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,670
software, if there are bugs,
then these can be missed for

68
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,570
years and years. And these
effects a lot of scientific

69
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,340
results downstream. So having
open source reviewable software,

70
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,250
it's very important for
reproducible, good quality

71
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,900
science. A lot of the journals
are adopting this and starting

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,630
to require disclosure or
publishing have your source code

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,750
for all of your software to this
is from a scientific

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,200
perspective, really a good thing
for the community. So how do you

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,900
know if something is open
source? You'll see on a lot of

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,270
GitHub repositories, which I
think everyone here is familiar

77
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,260
with, thanks to OLS is a little
license icon on the right hand

78
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,700
side of the repository. Also on
things like slides, so you can

79
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,170
see the CC by of these, this
slide deck at the top, you can

80
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,720
look for a couple of different
files within the license. And

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,990
these files need to be there if
it's going to be open source

82
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,960
software that she can reuse. But
it's not just for software. I

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,140
know I talk a lot about software
but it's also for data. There

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,020
are different licenses for data
for things like databases that

85
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,740
you want to make accessible for
photos or training materials,

86
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,730
things like this. All these are
options. And if you want people

87
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,530
to be able to use them, you need
to license

88
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,839
them. One of common fears I hear
about a lot is, if I published

89
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,409
my software online, if I do it
in the open, it'll be I'll be

90
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,289
scooped someone will take my
software and claimants thrown.

91
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,369
But this isn't necessarily true.
If someone steals your software,

92
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:24,509
there is at least a traceable
log in GitHub, or which we'll

93
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,679
get to in a minute. There is a
copy of your software already

94
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,529
online. And if you already have
a community around that, it'll

95
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,229
be very obvious that someone
took it. And if you're still

96
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,449
worried, I've heard some people
saying that they publish

97
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,259
preprints as a way to document
that, hey, they were first write

98
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,499
the software, and to really make
sure they stake their claim on

99
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:48,089
that software. So don't worry
about that just work in the

100
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:50,399
open, it's better for the
community, it's better for the

101
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,159
world. And it's good for
science, publishing, sharing

102
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,069
open source code. One of the
easiest and most effective ways

103
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,369
to do this is version control.
I'm sure you're all learning

104
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,789
about getting GitHub if you
haven't already. But version

105
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,579
control is fantastic way to
publish and share code with

106
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,579
others. It gives you a whole
timeline of your software, and

107
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,899
it makes it easy to reuse,
contribute and make

108
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,919
modifications to your software.
So why collaborating is easy.

109
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:21,119
One of the common things is
reverting accidents. If you make

110
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,489
some bad changes in your code,
or one of your collaborators

111
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:26,099
does, you can always revert you
can always go back to before

112
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,189
then it makes it easy to
integrate the changes from

113
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,089
multiple developers. Like with
galaxy, there are some 200

114
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,209
contributors to the code base or
the training materials as well.

115
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,959
And all of us can work together
collaboratively because we use

116
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,769
version control. Also offsite
copies of your software,

117
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,089
everyone has computer issues,
everyone loses a hard drive at

118
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,319
some point or gets their
harddrive encrypted by some

119
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,949
hackers things like this. If you
have all of your work in the

120
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,979
open in public, then you can
just download a new copy again

121
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,049
and start working in Git and
GitHub are very common, a very

122
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,199
common choice. Git is one of the
most common version control

123
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,559
systems, there are others.
GitHub, likewise, is one of the

124
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:15,389
most common git hosts. But
there are others depends on what

125
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,509
you want to use. One of the nice
things you get with GitHub is a

126
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,599
large existing user base and
large community of people who

127
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,659
will be able to contribute to
your software to low barrier for

128
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:29,279
entry. If you need to learn more
about git, there is a great set

129
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,129
of lessons from software
carpentries. But one of the

130
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,729
important notes is that Git is
very, very complex. My partner

131
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:42,239
teaches a get together session
where they teach how to use Git

132
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:45,809
to the colleagues in our office.
And there is just so much to

133
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:48,479
learn about git, but you don't
need to learn all of it. Now.

134
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,479
Just start with the important
parts, the rest comes later.

135
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,299
There, you'll see a lot of
guides online that will say oh,

136
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,789
you need to learn about how the
commit craft works and things

137
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,119
like this. But if you just want
to publish your code, you don't

138
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:03,719
need any of the fancy stuff. So
a few steps to make your work

139
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,249
open source. It README is a very
important part of us. If you

140
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:11,429
want people to know what your
software is and how to start

141
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:15,329
using it. That's the number one
thing people will see. So be

142
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,599
sure to include lots of good
images there. License, if it

143
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,239
has, if it's going to be open
source, it needs a license file.

144
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,599
So it takes two minutes
to add a license to GitHub,

145
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,009
it's really easy just doing same
thing with the contributing guide, GitHub

146
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,829
has some template contributing
guides that make it really easy

147
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,969
to tell people how you want them
to contribute to your to your

148
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,039
repositories. Having a public
roadmap, we aim to talk about

149
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,459
the Kanban boards and the agile.
Having a public roadmap is a

150
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,369
great way to tell community,
what you're working on what

151
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,949
features you're going to
implement things like that, that

152
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:54,299
can help people get excited for
your software. Publishing list

153
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,959
of issues same, it feels bad to
say, hey, my software has bugs.

154
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,899
But at least putting them out in
the open, you can track the

155
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,049
things you've done or not done.
A Code of Conduct assumptions

156
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,169
you've learned from OLS is very
important thing. Contact and

157
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,809
citation can be very useful as
well. If you have a GitHub

158
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,069
repository, you can easily get
those from Zenodo and Figshare.

159
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,429
If you need a DOI, there's a
nice website for how to choose a

160
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,169
license. There are lots of
different license choices. And

161
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,109
they give you a lot of different
freedom to choose what you want

162
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:28,079
your software to be able to do
or what you want other people to

163
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,869
be able to do with your
software. Some people don't want

164
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:34,589
businesses to use their software
for free. And there are licenses

165
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:37,289
that support this or some people
want everyone to use it for

166
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:40,949
free. Lots of different choices.
But the ultimate goal, of

167
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,589
course, is full reproducibility.
And we're getting a lot closer

168
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,169
with things like Jupiter and
binder where you can publish

169
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,479
your software but also a
notebook where people can run

170
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:51,389
your software online, which is a
fantastic way to get people to

171
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,259
use your software.

172
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,400
Taking it further. There's a lot
of ways for you to contribute if

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
you're a first time contributor
and to get involved in the open

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,090
Source Software movement and
contributing to the open source

175
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,970
communities. So there are lots
of nice links here if you want

176
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,090
to explore them. And lastly is
the Turing way has a nice

177
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,690
handbook on reproducible data
science and making software open

178
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,260
source and publishing and making
accessible to people. So with

179
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,070
that, thank you
