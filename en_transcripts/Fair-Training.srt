1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Alex Holinski: My name is Alex. I work
as a scientific training officer

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,760
at EMBL-EBI, so the European
bioinformatics Institute in the

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,810
UK, and as a scientific training
officer, well, what do I do? I

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,750
work together with scientific
experts and bioinformaticians

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,860
to develop, organize and run
bioinformatics training courses.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,140
I, I'm training as you see, I
also am used to prepare training

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,100
material. I also support
others and preparing training

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,190
material and sharing the sand.
Yeah, this is why I'm here to

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,720
talk about FAIR training now.
Well, why should you actually

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,120
care about sharing your
training, material sharing

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,740
training material can have a lot
of benefits. And there are a lot

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,550
of reasons for sharing it. For
example, other people who will

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,220
look for the training material
online, they can use it as a

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,520
sole source for self study, and
gain a lot of new knowledge from

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,150
this. But not only for trainees,
it can be beneficial, but also

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,600
for trainers, they can use the
training material they find

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,710
online as a source of
inspiration. They can even reuse

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,410
the training material and edit
it and build upon it, which can

19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,860
save them a lot of time and
money. But also trainers who put

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,530
their training material online
and can get a lot of

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,430
recognition, of course. So this
all sounds great. But when we

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,730
look for training material
online, either as trainees

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,360
because we needed for self-study, 
or we are looking for

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,150
something as a source of
inspiration, as in the in the

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,410
role of a trainer, we know that
a lot of questions can occur. So

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,080
for example, and we might
wonder, well, where can we

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,680
actually find suitable training
material? And if we have found

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,100
that we might want to when was
it written? Is it still up to

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,890
date? Or Who wrote it? I still
have more questions about the

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,780
content. can I contact anyone?
Or another question might be in

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,350
which context was context was
the training material presented?

32
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,550
And another important question
is, can I actually reuse the

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,570
training material material? Am I
legally allowed to do so. So you

34
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,960
see that a lot of questions can
pop up. And this is why it's so

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,380
important if you're sharing from
my training material to do that

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,410
in a FAIR way. So in a way that
it is findable, accessible,

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,360
interoperable and reusable.
applying the principles of

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,570
training materials provides a
framework for enabling and

39
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,630
sharing and about and thereby
helping train us to make the

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,900
most of the material but also
help them train us to get

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,030
trainees to get the most
efficient learning experience.

42
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,190
So now, how can we make training
material FAIR, so there was a

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,940
very great publication, which
gives an overview of 10 simple

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,970
rules for tracking, making
training materials FAIR and in

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,490
the following, I will now run
through these 10 rules. And at

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,280
the, in the very last minutes of
my talk, I will also very

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,600
quickly show you how we at EMBL-EBI
apply these guidelines to our

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,800
training. So how can you make
your training materials more

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,910
fIndable? First, you have to
describe it properly. And by

50
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,180
doing so, or you should do so by
annotating it with structured

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,810
metadata as of data which
describes your material. And,

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,370
for example, bio schema is an
initiative which facilitates the

53
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,000
addition of metadata to life
science resources, and this

54
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,750
helps to make it more findable
online. And you should also

55
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,650
annotate it with keywords using
structured controlled

56
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,310
vocabularies. And I will give a
more concrete example of this.

57
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,550
At the very end, we'll refer
back to this at the very end of

58
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,530
my talk. Also, you should give
it a unique identifier attaching

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,190
and persistent identifier to
your training material makes it

60
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,910
more easy to track online, but
also will help you to be able to

61
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,520
or will make it citable. And
you can also assign a persistent

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,780
identifier to the author. And we
have already heard about your

63
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,190
ORCID, which simply helps to
identify the the author

64
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,800
unambiguously online. Of course,
you should also add your

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,040
training material to an online
repository so that other people

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,740
know that it exists. And these
repositories can be

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,470
institutional ones, but they can
also be open once this can be

68
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,860
general once or more more field
specific ones we have already

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,070
heard some, for example,
Zenodo, which is a more general

70
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,640
one. And in the bioinformatics
field, we for example, have

71
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,610
"ELXIRE Tess"
is the life science training

72
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,760
portal where you can find a lot
of bioinformatics and life

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,990
science training material.

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,300
Well, how to make your training
material accent more accessible

75
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,220
by making it finable in a
repository and assigning a

76
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,540
persistent identifier to it you
already are nearer to the target

77
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,240
to make it more accessible for
others. But then the

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,870
accessibility of training
material can vary for different

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,440
reasons. There might be
material, which is more

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,140
restricted, where the access is
more restricted because it's for

81
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,720
example, only accessible for
specific If members of a

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,590
university or payment might be
required, all training material

83
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,610
can be completely open. It's
always very important to clearly

84
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,090
and state clearly define how
people can access the material.

85
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,840
And even maybe also do this in
plain English so that there is

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,680
absolutely no confusion of how
people and can access it so that

87
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,920
it will be simply more and be
more accessible by being

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,060
transparent about this. Well,
how can you make your training

89
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,300
material more interoperable, and
when you share training

90
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,020
material, you should always keep
in mind that other people might

91
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,290
want to reuse it might to edit
it might want to build upon it.

92
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,060
And you also have to consider
that other people might want to

93
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,240
use the training material across
different computational systems,

94
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,660
or might even want to use it
offline. So you have to balance

95
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,810
them carefully which format
you want to take for your

96
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,860
training material. For example,
if you give a presentation, and

97
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,150
you think about presenting it in
PowerPoint format, well, this is

98
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,220
always very helpful. If because
people are trainers can edit

99
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,540
this very easily and can build
upon it. If you For example,

100
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,480
compare this with a PDF format,
which is not so easily editable,

101
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,620
but then a PDF form but is, of
course, much more easily usable

102
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,170
across different computational
systems. So you have to

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,470
carefully consider this when you
deliver training. Well, how can

104
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,580
you make your training even more
reusable, it's very important

105
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,120
that you assign a license to
your training material. So this

106
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,420
will allow other people's to
know if they are allowed to read

107
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,720
that and how they are allowed to
use that. And also tell them how

108
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,130
materials should be cited when
they reuse it. Also add more

109
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,670
metadata to describe the context
of the material. And that's

110
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,850
helped the trainers to get more
information about your material.

111
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,330
This should for example, include
when was the material written

112
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,800
and Who wrote it? Where was it
presented, in what context and

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,430
what was the trade at the target
or the audience of the event and

114
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,230
portfolio learning outcomes of
this event. Also, keep your

115
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,400
training material up to date,
and clearly state when it was

116
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,820
last updated, and also welcome
contribution. So encourage

117
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,670
others to provide feedback and
contribute to the further

118
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,500
development of your material. So
I have given you now a lot of

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,670
guidelines, in theory. And in
the following and last few

120
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,520
minutes, I would very quickly
like to show you how we apply

121
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,300
these guidelines and for our
training that we deliver, or

122
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,150
that we provide at EMBL. So
first, we, as I've already told

123
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,960
you, we offer bioinformatics
training. And our training is

124
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,530
comprised of life and training
courses, which are face to face

125
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,890
courses, not at the moment, of
course, but also virtual courses

126
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,980
and life seminars. And we also
have on demand training. So

127
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,010
online training, like online
tutorials, recorded webinars,

128
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,510
and course materials and you can
access and find every all of our

129
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,310
training offer on our course web
page, we made the following

130
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,540
error very quick, very more
refer to the online tutorials we

131
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,860
have. So we describe our online
materials properly by for

132
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,250
example, using EDAM Ontology so
EDAM Ontology is a set of

133
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,970
controlled vocabularies, which
describes concepts which are

134
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,620
very common in methods and
computational biology. We also

135
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,280
link the EMBL-EBI resources, so
the databases that are covered

136
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,860
in the training tutorials, to
the tutorials, and we also

137
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,220
describe them, I'm using extra
terms and keywords which

138
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,970
describe the topics of the
tutorials by this, we aid the

139
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,550
search and to search
autocomplete function on our

140
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,960
page. We also give unique
identifiers to our tutorials.

141
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,530
For example, you can see here
that we have a DOI. And with

142
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,640
this digital object identifier,
we make this tutorial citable

143
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,270
by others, and also our authors
they have ORCID assigned to

144
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,220
them. So they are also
unambiguously identifiable. We

145
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,770
also make our material reusable,
we have licenses assigned to our

146
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,240
material. We for example, I'm
used to CC-BY SA license, which

147
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,110
allows other people to use our
material to transform it and

148
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,950
rebuild on it. But they should
give us credit and also share it

149
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,420
under the same license again.

150
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,590
We also keep our training
material up to date, we keep it

151
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,910
up to date or we review it once
a year and we clearly states on

152
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,780
the page on the web page when it
was last updated. What is now

153
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,130
not shown here is that we also
asked our trainees for feedback.

154
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,430
So we use standard feedback
forms where we really encourage

155
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,430
people to let us know what I
think about our training

156
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,490
material and to give us some
helpful feedback so that we can

157
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,230
revise it and regularly so all
in all, I should say this is all

158
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,460
work in progress so we still can
make our training and much more

159
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,940
FAIRer. Because it's a long
process to really make it very

160
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,300
FAIR. And I'm For example, we
are working on adding further

161
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,930
metadata texts on to our
material and also expanding the

162
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,300
our materials just
to name a few examples with this

163
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,680
idea. And I've also provided
some more helpful resources. I

164
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,830
have included the paper here to
the 10 simple rules. And then

165
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,470
there are also two webinars
where you can which you can

166
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,870
watch where you can find more
information and I will also add

167
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,070
them to the to the living
document, which is provided. So

168
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,710
if we have time for questions,
and if there's any questions,

169
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,140
