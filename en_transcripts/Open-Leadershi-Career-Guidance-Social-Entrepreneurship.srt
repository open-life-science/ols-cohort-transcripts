1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
David Selassie Opoku: My name is David 
Selassie Opoku. I'm currently a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
farmer, I saw somebody mentioned
that that was one of his goals.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,500
So glad to see that. And also co
founder of Growing Gold Farms, and

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,460
also recently, fellow at the
Stanford digital civil society

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,570
lab, where exploring issues
around African food sovereignty.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,610
So to start off, I want to start
with the definition of social

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,940
intrapreneurship. I pick this up
from Shopify actually has a

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,670
definition that I like, and it
says that it's doing business

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,720
for social cause. It might also
be referred to as altruistic

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,530
intrapreneurship. Interesting.
And then it combines commerce

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,500
and social issues in a way that
improves the lives of people

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,880
connected to a cause. And their
success usually is not measured

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,540
in profit alone. But then he
asked the question, should an

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,450
entrepreneurship be social, then
because everything should

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,420
benefit people. So I tend to
generally look at it as

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,810
intrapreneurship should be
social. Now, I mentioned this,

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,980
because I think there's a strong
connection to open science and

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,030
the principles that exist within
open science and openness. I

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,960
think "The Turing Way" really
highlights some of these

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
aspects. If you've not checked
out a resource, you should check

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,630
it out. We share this already and the
team have mentioned this several

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,870
times. When we talk about
collaboration, we talk about

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,130
project design, we talk about
reproducibility, communication,

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,370
outreach, ethics, all these to
some extent, I lead into social

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,790
outcomes that benefit not just a
group of individuals, but

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,240
anybody, we're talking about
accessibility. I think anyone

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,750
who practices this, and sub
build enough skills, that ends

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,150
up being very relevant to social
enterpreneurship. So now I'm

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,080
going to talk about my journey.
And I hope through this, you'll

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,760
be able to see how what I ended
up doing to some extent, led me

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,850
to the path where I could feel a
little bit more comfortable or

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,900
adventures to be in a social
entrepreneur. So I'll start from

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,170
Ghana, I lived there for about
17 years of my life, lower

34
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,540
middle class, Christian family
farming family. And then I was

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,260
privileged to get a scholarship
to go to last two years of high

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,650
school in Costa Rica ended up
being in class with students

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,080
from over 65 different
countries, which started

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,990
exposing me to the world and
around commonalities that we had

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,750
and also differences. But I
think the heart of that became

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,840
that we are all very similar. We
all care about generally similar

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,240
issues. And, and that was a life
changing moment. I did six years

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,420
in the US where I did my
undergrad and my Master's in

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,750
biology, and then computer
science, and also did some

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,460
research with UNICEF, and a lot
of civic engagement work. And I

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,210
think in all of that, studying
to understand how what I was

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,800
learning was going to be helpful
to different individuals,

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,030
different communities, whatever
I did, should have an impact on

48
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,730
communities. I then returned to
Ghana, and worked at a tech

49
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,990
incubator. And one of the things
that I quickly became a champion

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,740
of because that really didn't
exist was the local Open Data

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,070
advocates. And the reason was
because at least in Ghana, at

52
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,010
that time, a lot of
intrapreneurs were trying to

53
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,790
build products, or trying to
work with data. But most of the

54
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,760
data sets were not
contextualized, to Ghana and

55
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,420
most of Africa. So I became the
person who was pushing this

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,760
forward, which then led me into
the open data space. I joined

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,210
Open Knowledge Foundation, which
is an organization that works in

58
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,810
promoting Open Data principles,
and was fortunate enough to

59
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,870
become the data what I call a
data plumber, helping

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,440
journalists, civil society
organizations, researchers think

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,920
about how open data principles
openness can be embedded into

62
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,210
the work that you do. At the
heart of that was really

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,320
recognizing that accessibility
in terms of solving issues was

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,460
was a big thing to pay attention
to. And I think in their became

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,780
the values that now have led me
to leaving to focus on building

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,190
a farm. And the reason why I
left become a farmer built Growing

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,180
Gold farm was because I saw a
problem that across the world,

68
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,640
we have an issue around how
we're going to feed the world,

69
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,150
farmers are a very important
group of people who are going to

70
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,090
be leading this, but at the same
time, most of the time, they

71
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,880
don't have access to the skills
and the resources that we need

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,200
to push this forward. And so
Growing gold Farm is seeming to figure

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,930
out ways to do that with farmers
in resource constraints

74
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,830
environments.

75
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,870
And so I've talked about social
enterpreneurship. I've talked

76
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,080
about open science, and I think
at the heart of all of those,

77
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,030
our community. You hear that
being repeated in these two

78
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,630
spaces, you hear about the
comments where there's

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,570
collective ownership of some
kind of research. was very

80
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,920
successful. And then you hear
about society. And I think for

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,870
anyone who believes in these
principles who practices this,

82
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,810
who uses this social
entrepreneurship is also an

83
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,480
avenue for you to explore
because you are definitely

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,730
unexpressed, and some of the
challenges that you deal with or

85
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,840
you have mastered, will become
relevant there. Um, so a little

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,170
bit about Growing Gold Farms, we
have four main phases that we

87
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,680
want to go through, one to
consistently produce healthy and

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,350
affordable food, using
sustainable and accessible

89
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,890
practices want to build the
capacity of other smallholder

90
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,950
farmers to produce sustainably
and smallholder farmers because

91
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,050
we believe that they actually
build or have the ethos around

92
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,900
sustainability, food sovereignty
that is needed in this world.

93
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,170
And we want to make smallholder
farms and farmers more

94
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,680
resilience to processing of
their produce, and then finally

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,830
want to turn farms into spaces
of education, innovation,

96
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:03,780
urgency, and how that's a day or
week look like. In a day or in a

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,810
week I'm reading or my team and
I were reading about ways of

98
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,130
implementing research to this
problem. So everything from

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,680
reading about freedom plants in
and about GMO, and why that

100
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,310
leads to outcomes that actually
doesn't benefit communities, or

101
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,680
even looking at science and ways
to make data much more

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,370
accessible. or helping my dad
was a farmer for over 40 years,

103
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,370
but doesn't really collect it.
And the way that makes it much

104
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,040
easier for him to appreciate
that and make that much more

105
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,330
accessible to him. So putting
together and unable to team up

106
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,210
on the latest. So that's level
of collaboration, we can do

107
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,240
things alone. So how do we bring
in teams of different experts to

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,970
do this, and then believing in
ourselves each and every day? So

109
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,060
I just wanted to say so social
enterpreneurship Should I do it

110
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,550
there, there are four things
that I put down that may be

111
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,150
helpful if you want to consider
this, um, you see a social age

112
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,390
that no one you know, is
solving. Yeah. So that may be

113
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,700
one factor to consider another.
If there's no fixed salary, no

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,000
problem. That's, that's
something we can talk about

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
later. But it's not, the comfort
of having a salary in other

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,990
spaces may not always be
guaranteed. You tend to be a

117
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,130
generalist by nature, but
especially it's by necessity. So

118
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,700
you do everything, and then you
specialize in specific areas

119
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,650
that you want, when it's needed.
And if not, now, when there's

120
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,200
something that you've always
wanted to explore, and maybe

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,810
now's the time you try it out,
and you figure out whether this

122
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,200
is a path to pursue, or maybe it
was a waste of your time, at

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,630
least you know that. So these
are some things that you will

124
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,010
consider if you want to pursue
this path. And then I want to

125
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,030
wrap up with three anecdotes
that I've picked up that I

126
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,020
believe have helped me so far.
And even other people that

127
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,820
advice when proceeded
intrapreneurship path. So be

128
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,400
versatile. And I said generalize
and then specialize think

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
socially intrapreneurship
leverages on the ability to

130
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,010
generalize, being interested in
different things, different

131
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,950
issues, and how to solve that,
and then finding a way to

132
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,780
specialize in whatever that
issue is. And again, so for me

133
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,870
being able to understand data,
but being able to understand

134
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,780
product development, being able
to understand different

135
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,600
societies and cultures and the
way that they behave. And then

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,910
specializing on a specific
skills, I think social

137
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,820
intrapreneurship gives you the
ability to start off as a

138
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,490
generalist and then look at an
issue and where you want to

139
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:39,390
specialize in that. Um, I think
to do this, you need to see

140
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,780
people are the heart of this is
people that you're working with,

141
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,690
they're either dealing with
issues, or they're innovating,

142
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,570
and being able to start with
them as people before whatever

143
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,020
technology whatever solution is
important. But also letting

144
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,090
yourself be seen. As opposed to
either be in academia, or even

145
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,090
being in a lab. it being a
social entrepreneur, you need to

146
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,220
be out there, you need to be
talking to customers, you need

147
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,500
to be talking to communities
need to be building that

148
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,980
relationship, but you also have
to let people see you. Let them

149
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,480
know you for who you are.

150
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,710
And so that's important. And
that's one of the anecdotes that

151
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,690
I've picked over time. And then
this is kind of a joke, but gound

152
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,390
the identity in your job,
actually do not ground the

153
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:27,960
identity in your job, your job
will go, but who you are as a

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,550
person wouldn't. And I think
being able to find ways to

155
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,770
thrive outside your job, whether
it's as a social entrepreneur,

156
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,210
whether it's as somebody who is
in a company who is in a

157
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,050
university in a lab, letting
your identity not be grounded in

158
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,870
that because that could always
change is a valuable thing that

159
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,750
I've learned. In the past maybe
six months, there have been many

160
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,290
opportunities that I have feel
that I have not been accepted in

161
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,890
and learning and that that is
not what my identity is. My

162
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,170
identity is beyond that. It's
been something that keeps me

163
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,750
going. So without my last thing
that I'll say is that brief, the

164
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,800
most important thing, especially
in this time of COVID is your

165
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,820
life. Everything else is
replaceable. And I think if you

166
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,760
want to go down the path of a
social enterpreneur or any other

167
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,510
career option, just making sure
that you live in a life that is

168
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,490
balanced, that you can thrive
and be healthy as well. We'll

169
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,090
keep you going into whatever
path you take. So stay human,

170
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,900
and be open. And with that, I
will end here
