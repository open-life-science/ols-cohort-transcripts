1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,390
Carlos Martinez: Okay, so, Amy, I think
you're quite close to Amsterdam

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,390
Science Park, right? Amy: Yes, I am.
Carlos Martinez: I think that if you go to,

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,870
so there's a cycle path that
goes from Amsterdam Science

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,440
Park,

5
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:22,379
and and then you can cycle along
the canal for a bit, and then

6
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,799
you go through Weesp, which is
quite nice. And then you can

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,059
cycle all the way to Bussum.
So we did this one last summer.

8
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,539
And it is actually quite nice
because Bussum is like,

9
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,919
completely surrounded, it has
like a moat around the whole

10
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,589
city. So very nice cycle
patterns quite short. I think

11
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:48,569
for you it will be maybe under
an hour, you should be there.

12
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:53,999
Okay, now I'm hoping that
everybody else is who is

13
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:58,349
thinking, who is this guy? What
is he talking about? Why is he

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,459
ignoring the rest of us? And
what is he what what's the point

15
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:08,069
of this talk? That was exactly
my point is I'm doing this in a

16
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,899
presentation. Usually you start
by saying, Hi, my name is Carlos

17
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,389
Martinez, I work for the ISA and
center. And I'm going to be

18
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:19,439
talking to you about README
files, does the part of the

19
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,619
presentation where you usually
introduce yourself and tell

20
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,129
people, this is what I'm going
to be telling you in the next

21
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:31,829
five to 10 minutes. So I
deliberately asked Amy to help me

22
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,849
to do completely the opposite to
show a bad example of how you

23
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:42,299
should not make a presentation.
Because it's the same thing that

24
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,679
you have with a readme file. So
I'm going to be telling you

25
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:51,569
about README files, how README
files are useful to communicate

26
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:58,079
about your project. So README
files are really like a welcome

27
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,879
the welcoming part of your
project, they're the

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,869
presentation card for your
project, where you would say,

29
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,819
Okay, this is my introduction
card, this is my project. This

30
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,879
is what my project is about.
This is what my project does.

31
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,679
And it should provide you all of
the initial information for your

32
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:23,129
project for whether you're going
to what this project is about,

33
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:27,329
what I don't know if it's a
software project, what type of

34
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,679
software it is, which
dependencies it uses on which

35
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:36,089
language is written, what's the
what problem it solves. So these

36
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,889
are all the things that you want
to have in your README file for

37
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:46,289
introducing your project. When
somebody finds your project on

38
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,729
GitHub, and they read your
README file, that's the first

39
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,129
thing that they see does the
first impression that they have

40
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,359
about your project. And that's
the basically, that's the moment

41
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:03,719
where people meet your project.
And that's either they like

42
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,239
project or they don't like your
project, either they will use

43
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,449
your software or they will not
use your software. But a README

44
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,119
is very important, because it's
that first moment that is that

45
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:15,809
introduction to your project
these days, your projects

46
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:20,609
landing page is your projects
presentation card. So that's why

47
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,819
the README are very important.
Usually README in GitHub, you

48
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,869
on software projects, you just
have a file, which is a plain

49
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:36,419
text file called README with all
capitals, or README. Mark, you

50
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,699
can use markdown on README, as
well. And that's the first page

51
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:47,639
that you will have on your
GitHub repository. So in your

52
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,549
README, what are the important
things that you should have in

53
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,109
your README? If you should say,
what was your project is doing?

54
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,869
For whom? And why? So this is
really giving the context to

55
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:06,059
your project? You should tell a
what makes your project special?

56
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:10,469
Why did you build this new
software library that does the

57
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,479
same that other libraries, what
sets your your specific software

58
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,259
or your specific tool, or your
specific project apart from

59
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:25,139
other projects that are already
out there? And how do how to get

60
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,929
started? So if this is a
software project, how would you

61
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,659
install this tool? Or how would
you use it? Or if it's a, I

62
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,679
don't know if it's a book, like
the Turing way, how how you

63
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,469
would get started contributing
to this project? Or how would

64
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:45,089
you get started using this
project? And usually, it's also

65
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,679
also always a good idea to point
to useful resources about your

66
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:54,179
project. So again, if it's a
software project, and it's

67
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:58,349
already distributed through
package manager, where can you

68
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,369
find the link to To the package
manager that manages your

69
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,399
software, or if this is the

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,640
the README for a project, and
you have a website, maybe you

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,260
also want to point to your
website. So where are all the

72
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,490
other resources that are useful
and relevant for your project?

73
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:28,740
Okay. So again, in terms of bad
examples, good examples. If this

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,910
was my software project, and
this is my README file, this is

75
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,410
a terrible README file. So it
has the name of my project, and

76
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,390
it tells you how, how do I run
my code and how to cite my

77
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,830
paper? But it doesn't tell you
what my software does. Why would

78
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,820
you use it? In which context?
would you use it? What problem

79
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,810
does it solve? How is it
written? Where is the

80
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,500
documentation, so there is
absolutely no information about

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,230
it? Maybe it's useful for me to
remember how to run my code. But

82
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,950
even for myself, in three weeks
time, I will forget what my

83
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,410
project was about. And I would
remember was the tool that I was

84
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,730
using for this No, I don't know,
I don't remember anymore. So I

85
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,560
think this is the best example I
could think of of a terrible

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,210
README file. Maybe the The only
thing that could be worse is to

87
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:32,610
not have a README file at all.
Now, a good example, this is the

88
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,890
README file from the Turing Way.
These tells you what is The Turing

89
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,960
Way, it tells you that it's a
lightly opinionated guide, and

90
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,210
it tells you that it's aimed for
researchers, and I think, yes,

91
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,060
it also tells you where can you
find the the guide and in a

92
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,920
readable format, or not in the
README file format. So you can

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,690
go to the-turing-way.netlify.app
So it's telling you what it

94
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:11,670
does, who is it aim for and point you to
useful resources. And one thing

95
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,520
that I love is that you even
points you to README file in

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,210
different languages. So that's a
really nice example of a REAME

97
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:26,130
file. So yeah, so that those are
the main things that I think you

98
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,810
should be thinking, thinking
about when you write your README

99
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:37,620
file. So reiterating what they
already said is the welcome

100
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,360
message to your website, you
should share all the important

101
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,470
information about your project,
what's your project, mission

102
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,590
vision, what you want to do with
this project. And it's also a

103
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,190
good place where you can link to
relevant information, for

104
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,380
example, licenses, code of
conduct, which as we just heard,

105
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,680
from how it's important to state
your license for software

106
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,800
projects, and other types of
projects. Another thing that I

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,050
think it's important to consider
is where your software is going

108
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,410
to where your README is going to
be used. So if you write your

109
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,060
README on GitHub, and maybe this
is a little bit, I'm switching

110
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,160
to a very software specific
example. But if you're so if you

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,900
write a software tool, and your
software is on GitHub, your

112
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,510
users will look at your README
on GitHub, but they will also be

113
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,170
able to see your README in other
places, because once you connect

114
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,800
your GitHub account with other
places your README gets like

115
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:55,380
harvested by Docker hub or by PyPy
and your README ends up in

116
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,910
other places as well. And maybe
also your if you generate the

117
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,140
website automatically from your
GitHub repo, your README ends up

118
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:11,610
there as well. So it's always
useful to think, how is your How

119
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,260
are your readers going to read
the README? So try to always

120
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,180
consider who's going to read
your README file and in which

121
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,430
context, they're going to read
it.

122
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:33,630
And so README files context.
Now, what are my top tips for

123
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,480
reading? I think this is an
exercise I believe that we want

124
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,910
to do later. But

125
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,920
basically, I think that my take
home message on README files is

126
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,020
that you should always try to be
clear, and try to always think

127
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,730
of your reader always think
who's going to read it. What

128
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,010
information do they need? What
will they learn? From the readme

129
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,830
file and a What do I want them
to learn by reading my README

130
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,160
file. So what is information
that they want to convey to them
