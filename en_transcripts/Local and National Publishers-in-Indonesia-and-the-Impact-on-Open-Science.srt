1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Zulidyana Rusnalasari: My name is Zulidyana 
Rusnalasari, you can call me

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,690
Lydia or Jana, I'm a public
relations official have their

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,020
own general Indonesia is
nonprofit organizations to help

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,490
together people and sharing
their knowledge. And what we are

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,640
different from the others
nonprofit organization, because

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,580
actually, when we started, we
don't know much about journal

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,480
publications, academic
publication, and so on. We're

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,190
growing together, learning and
sharing and updating all the

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,840
time. That's why I, in the
title, I call it, it's a never

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,650
ending learning because we
always do the learning process

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,560
from the beginning of the
organization. And until now. So

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,920
first of all, I will tell you
about the story about Indonesia

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,110
during this five years. So we
have to make up publishers, in

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,990
journals, and academies. There
are several very big publishers,

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:23,160
they really dominate almost all
subjects. Even in Indonesia,

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,910
even we have the language
barriers. So as you know that

17
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,120
English is not my native
language, I am Indonesians. But

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,910
because I learned English
literature, and so on. So I can

19
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,710
overcome those language barriers.
So pardon me if my English is

20
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,380
not really good. But I will try
my best to explain you about the

21
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,880
stories of about 
puplishers in Malaysia. We lack

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,530
sources. And we also lack
support. That's why it's

23
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:10,860
like we, we were in 2016, we
started this organization, like

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,310
some people in a dark room. And
we have to some people in the

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,900
tap room, and we close our eyes.
So even when our eyes just

26
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,040
opened, we still cannot see
anything. That's why we have to

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,400
make the light itself by
sharing. So this picture is

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,560
created by Mr. Irwin, that will
be present next week. Our local

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,900
and national publisher is just
like this, and we are surviving

30
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,230
until now. And we are still
growing and the number of

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,320
journals in Indonesia is growing
very fast. And this is not all

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,660
journalism, Indonesia is about
business. But mostly we share

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,540
because we want to participate.
So that started in 2016. There

34
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,660
were changed in government
regulation in scientific

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:23,070
publication for from printed to
online. So they gather people's

36
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,520
gather information from
trainings and meetings. But

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,810
sadly at the time, those
trainings and those meetings are

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,630
very expensive. We have some
organization that already well

39
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,590
literally about this academic
publishing, but they are so

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,570
explosives. So we have to spend
more than in a very big amount

41
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,290
of money. But the institution is
fairly diverse. Small

42
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,640
institutions also have journal
publishing, so they cannot

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,150
afford to join the trainings and
meetings. That's why in 2016, we

44
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,710
started these organizations.
Some general managers from

45
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,760
across Indonesia gather and
start the idea to build an NGO,

46
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,700
the nonprofit want to educate,
this is not meaning that we will

47
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:30,060
advocate it now but we started
in a very basic level of

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,210
knowledge support academic
publishing show. We are building

49
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,640
a community. We have the general
managers along with also center

50
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,330
viewers.

51
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:58,560
And in 2007 and 2020. When we
when we launch our one of our we

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,780
will launch one of our or
publications, a program. We have

53
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,980
these pictures from outside the
organization. So Mr. Edward is

54
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,360
drawing this. But actually, he's
not part of our organization.

55
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,920
But he was saying that, as an
organization, we have the

56
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,750
skills, we have the knowledge,
and we have the public support.

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:38,340
That's what power us, because we
want to say, have research that

58
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,410
really engaging to all people,
not only for those in academia,

59
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,600
but also for society. And it
also can influence the

60
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,140
government in the long run. But
the potential that we have in

61
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,430
the corners of Indonesia, in the
corners of 1000s, of islands,

62
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:06,180
Indonesia, so has already known
by peoples not only from the

63
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,820
academy publication, but also
for all people that becomes, for

64
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,420
example, like teachers, or
lecturers, students, even those

65
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,940
who are claiming themselves as
researchers, because we have a

66
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,830
challenge that when we read
about sources, mostly sources

67
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,010
are in English. But actually the
sources that already in our

68
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,640
country haven't published yet.
So the language barrier becomes

69
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,290
a homework for us. But we
dealing with that, because many

70
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,480
of people's in, in the
organizations are volunteer,

71
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,430
they are giving their time,
they're giving their energy, and

72
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,960
they're also giving the ideas to
building up this nonprofit

73
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,870
organization. So if we talk
about open science in Indonesian

74
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,890
journals, technically,
practically, mostly because we

75
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:20,940
are using VGS as the platform by
big IP, but the openness itself

76
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,510
actually started because we are
volunteers that getting

77
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,100
together, we are growing for
only bunch of people. Now we

78
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,280
have more than 200 volunteers
around Indonesia, in Turkey, in

79
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,450
in four, sorry, Indonesia has 34
provinces. So in each provinces,

80
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,620
we have representations
representative person, who

81
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:53,610
manage to be the person, the P
IC person, that probably if

82
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,190
people need help, can come back
this person, if this person

83
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,880
cannot afford to help them, they
can come back us in, in the

84
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,870
center of Indonesia to to come
to the cities or they're found.

85
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,060
We work together to assist, you
know, managers, this is very

86
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,530
challenging, because not all
people it's very limited people

87
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,690
in Indonesia that has computer
illiterate, they also have the

88
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,310
language barrier. So technical
problem, internet connection,

89
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,960
and also, the literacy becomes
our problem. At first in during

90
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:47,460
three years. We start our
training by building awareness,

91
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,820
why academic publication is
important for us. Why writing in

92
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,510
academic way is important. Why
people have to read why. So

93
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,280
those basic ideas and skills are
everywhere. It's just like a

94
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,730
very big homework for us. But
this community now become a

95
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,470
place to find answers because we
have a platform, we build a

96
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,450
platform that people can
register lock in and

97
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,600
asked because those 200
volunteers already there to

98
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:33,810
answer the question for our
around Indonesia so they can

99
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,520
drop the questions. We answer we
also provide a YouTube tutorial.

100
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,220
We also provide facts, examples
and so on. In many sources. We

101
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:51,900
also use zenodo to let's say
keeping our documents so

102
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:58,890
everybody can access. Very, we
also have I said before coffee,

103
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,430
it Usually we also going places
in Indonesia to have training,

104
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:13,800
meeting them face to face and
train them how to manage a

105
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,280
journal, academic journal,
provide even and mostly free of

106
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,360
charts because now during
coffee, all of them are online.

107
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,360
So these events is regularly
like, once in a week. Sometimes

108
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,270
we do it once in two days for
like salaries. For example, like

109
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,490
we collaborate with the oaG. We
collaborate with them. So we

110
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:48,810
can, let's say, having salaries
of training. The best line that

111
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,210
makes us always drawing is
culture of sharing. Because this

112
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,560
sharing even the knowledge is
very limited in one person, but

113
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,150
we share it and this part of
little knowledge that we have,

114
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:09,000
and and then it's also join with
the others people that also

115
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,150
probably just read our
knowledge, those little

116
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,020
knowledge becomes the mountain
of knowledge Academy, a

117
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:22,140
researcher, librarian, etc.
Everyone, everyone who concerned

118
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,900
about academic publication
journals. Usually they becomes

119
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:36,300
our big supporters. And we
collaborate to grow LTE, US

120
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,500
Indonesian dinar fowl and
Association, because we are a

121
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,360
nonprofit organization. But
concern is more in management,

122
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,010
the scientific journals in a
niche gap. And to support it, we

123
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,340
collaborate with our kids. We
have a good number of our kids,

124
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,390
and four of the crossref
ambassadors from Indonesia, our

125
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,190
energy volunteers, including me
becomes the concept ambassadors.

126
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,830
And we also building a good
network with lippie lippie is

127
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,120
Indonesian instead of Sciences
is a government Institute of

128
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,210
sciences to the UN. For this
collaboration, we developed what

129
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:30,090
we call a journal stories that
AI This is the platform still in

130
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,660
building. I mean, it hasn't
launched yet, because we plan to

131
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:45,570
launch this platform in June in
this June 2021. This platform

132
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,970
becomes a hub between scientific
journal manager scientific

133
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,710
journal Management Association
and scientific associations. So

134
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,690
to that we have a different
point of view here in Indonesia.

135
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,920
Because we don't, we don't
actually we don't feel

136
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,860
comfortable with the link from
scimago, for example, because we

137
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,160
don't really comfortable with
that. We create our network by

138
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:25,020
also bringing up the scientific
associations. So the ones that

139
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,850
we believe that those people in
associations in scientific

140
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:36,540
Association are people can let's
say they can charge whether this

141
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,170
journal has to improve in what
way? Is it a good journal? Or is

142
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:49,650
it journal that need to improve
improvement? We are not saying

143
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,950
any bad journals, because we
don't have any blacklisted

144
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,590
journals. Now, we are concerning
about improving not

145
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,790
blacklisting, including and
excluding indexing. That's not

146
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,580
our main goal, because we build
ourselves from scratch. So we

147
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,140
want everyone's to know
managers, reviewers, our users,

148
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,410
they are keeping the quality as
a community along with a

149
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,880
scientific Association.

150
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,020
So the upsetness of course,
pragmatic people around

151
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,210
Indonesia, there are so many
pragmatic people they get the

152
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,320
there are also some people
becomes mafia publication. They

153
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,250
provide instant publication and
ethical practice of publication.

154
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,880
And the second big obstacle is
the culture of writing. In

155
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,290
addition, people have a culture
of speaking and telling stories,

156
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,800
but they're not really good in
writing. Actually, writing is

157
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:04,260
one of our biggest obstacle. To
get in touch with the publishing

158
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:11,850
in Academy, and the obstacles is
the competition among education

159
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,160
institution, for me, because I,
you know, there are so many

160
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,830
competitions, because of the
rank, and that make us compete

161
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,520
most. But most of the ways
actually the sometimes it's not

162
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,130
appropriate. That's why in
journal stories later, we don't

163
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,870
have any rank. But we have
stickers and labels just like we

164
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:46,080
are doing in games. And into in
2020 mga as a nonprofit

165
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,240
organization, but we can become
the bronze sponsor for it, we

166
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,630
have more than 10 people becomes
associate editors. And we have

167
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,720
also three people becomes
editors into it, this is our

168
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:12,240
milestone to participate in open
science work light. And edgy

169
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,690
also become the biggest
processor affiliation in the

170
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:25,200
world. Because even we started
as community, we, we be, we we

171
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:32,160
help more than 5000 journals in
Indonesia and outside Indonesia,

172
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:41,880
that publice from 1500 local
properties is so we becomes the

173
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,190
number is getting high and high
because Institute's almost all

174
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,690
education institutions, building
their own journals publication.

175
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,920
Sometimes, probably, this is
bad, but actually we do it

176
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:09,240
because we want more quantity to
start the quality itself. So we

177
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,870
also as an organization, we also
pay, um, user journals, because

178
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,420
this is an open journal. This is
our pilot project. We call it up

179
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,570
letter, the pilot project
because we use open review. So

180
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,590
the reviewers and outers,
everything is open, the

181
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:38,520
reviewers can know this is not
blind review, because the author

182
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:46,830
knows who reviews their
manuscript. And reviewers also

183
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,510
participated voluntarily. We are
not bothered by the close rules

184
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,790
like subscribes or blind review,
or even dance for copyright.

185
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:07,020
Because this pub later is also
discuss about publication in

186
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:15,900
Indonesia. We also fund half a
fund funding for research in

187
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:24,510
academic publications in the
form to two groups of

188
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,760
researchers that research about
academic publication. So those

189
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,970
funding that we have, we share
it into it, our kit, and then

190
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:44,550
also with people who has ideas
to research in academic

191
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,850
publications. So the research
will be talking about

192
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,310
publications. Okay, this is my
last slide. Amano my last word

193
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,830
of the lifeless about Thank you.
We I call it never ending

194
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,240
learning because we encourage
also teachers to inform their

195
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,230
students, because we started to
look at to in the early age,

196
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:22,680
they can submit their manuscript
or their narrative science in

197
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,130
journal for school. This is also
our pilot projects. And I call

198
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,550
it never ending learning because
this is a very long route and

199
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:38,340
never ending because we always
update the informations the

200
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,020
system of the journal itself,
the changing rules in the

201
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,200
worldwide and the changing rules
in my governments. Sometimes

202
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:57,090
they're they're different in you
know, when they are deciding

203
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,360
what is good, what is bad. So
this Updating is doing all the

204
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,960
time. That's why the learning
process is always there. And the

205
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,890
off cycle one of them is also
the lack of Human Resources

206
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,490
along with language barriers, so
that we invite everyone here to

207
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,920
collaborate. If you want to
collaborate with us done. Don't

208
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,070
hesitate to drop an email for me
and celebrate this learning

209
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:37,590
process. Okay, that's all for my
presentation. In Indonesia, it

210
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,720
mediums in English, sharing to
enhance the publication's
