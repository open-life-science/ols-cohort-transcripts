00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Iratxe Puebla: My name is Iratxe Puebla and I'm an
Associate Director for as a

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,830
ASAPBio, which is a non for profit
organization with a mission to

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,370
drive innovation and
transparency to life sciences

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,660
communication. We have a great
interest in supporting adoption

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,110
and awareness around preprints
in terms of how life sciences is

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,200
communicated, I was gonna
mention a little bit for

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,730
context, the activities that we
run around preprints. We

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,120
regularly run projects and
gather stakeholders together to

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,240
discuss the different elements
of the preferences, ecosystem,

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,900
water, which are there perhaps
upcoming challenges or subjects

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,230
that may require on developing
some principles or structures

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,870
etc. We also develop resources
are related to preference mostly

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,770
focus on providing information
for results so that they can

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,710
make informed choices when they
choose to prepare, but they're

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,830
also available to obviously any
stakeholder in life in life

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,920
sciences communication. And we
also run the ASAPBio

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,120
community, which is an online
global community of mostly

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,690
researchers, but also some other
stakeholders, who also have an

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,560
interest in supporting again,
awareness and adoption of

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,910
preprints. So we're here to
talk preprints, what's

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,720
preprints, one of the
perennial common set of

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,410
questions and there is no common
definition or unique definition.

23
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,600
So I'm going to give you one
that covers quite a few of the

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,950
elements. Essentially, and many
of you may already be familiar

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,180
anyway with what preprint may 
encompass. But a preprint is

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,390
generally considered a scholarly
manuscript that is posted by the

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,590
authors to a 
repository or platform to

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,550
facilitate the open and broad
sharing of the early work

29
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,770
without limitations on access.
And a definition or description

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,880
that I quite like and I tend to
reuse is one that was mentioned

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,300
by John Inglis with who is the
co-founder of the preprint

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,780
servers by bioRxiv on medRxiv, 
who has to refer to

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,990
preprint as the "director's cut"
of a manuscript which essentially

34
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,260
assume that they also are happy
to share with our community and

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,280
our peers, knowing that perhaps
you may undergo changes they may

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,070
updated once they get feedback,
or it undergoes peer review. So

37
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,760
there are a number of elements
in that definition, and then how

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,240
we work with preprints. That may
sound very familiar to how we

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,840
publish articles and journals.
So I thought I would go very

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,330
briefly over some of the
similarities, but also how

41
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,780
preprints are different from
from journal articles. The

42
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,540
similarities is, as we said,
well, both articles and

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,650
preference report the scholarly
work. And generally again, some

44
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,230
preprint servers cover different
outputs. But generally a

45
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,380
preprint is the full paper with
all the information about the

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,680
study that allows others to
replicate it, to appraise it to

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,440
provide comments etc. preprints
are generally assigned a DOI,

48
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,350
there are some exceptions to
this like archive who we use,

49
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,560
they use their own persistent
identifier system. But again,

50
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,740
the majority in the majority of
cases, they receive a DOI so

51
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,390
that they traced unfound. And
obviously, they can decide that

52
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,810
if you have use that in your
work, you can add a reference on

53
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,830
again, find that through the
DOI. However, there are also

54
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,000
differences between preprints
and publications and journals.

55
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,630
The most important is that the
preprint servers we take will

56
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,590
take the version of the paper
that you submit, generally, they

57
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,920
do some basic screening just to
take that instant results

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,190
paper and there is nothing
hugely problematic. And they

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,290
will post the paper without peer
review. And a few other

60
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,660
differences that I thought was
worth mentioning is that

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,580
preference allow versioning.
Again, the authors This means

62
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,010
that the authors can post a new
version again, make updates on

63
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,910
new work to their paper and post
a new version on the server and

64
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,940
link to this it means that
correcting the paper if you need

65
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,970
to correct it tends to be much
easier and faster than when you

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,820
publish a paper that you're not
aware enough to go through the

67
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,790
editorial process again. So they
decide how do they post a

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,420
correction what goes into it,
etc. So from that perspective,

69
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,170
that there is an element of ease
and fluidity to use in

70
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,210
preprint. So why are the results
of using or choosing to use

71
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,120
preptint. The first important
benefit of preference is the

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,690
fact that there is the speed of
the dissemination. They allow

73
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:30,840
you

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,590
to make the work available
almost immediately. If you're

75
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,890
familiar with the journal
publication process, you will

76
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,130
know that it can take weeks or
months and sometimes if it goes

77
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,370
wrong even years to essentially
go through the editorial process

78
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,400
until the journal will publish
the work make it publicly

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,340
available. And obviously
sometimes you may get rejected

80
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,770
and you have to submit to another
journal and restart the clock

81
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,070
etc. By comparison, if you post
your paper to a preprint server,

82
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,060
it will be available in a matter
of days, generally, again,

83
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,490
depending on the screening
process, which means that you

84
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,030
have a record that you can sell
with your community and request

85
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,150
comments. And all of that can
happen very quickly. And you can

86
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,000
do it either before or in
parallel to also submit into

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,860
a journal. Another important
benefit of preprints is that

88
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,070
they are free to both post and
free to access, there is no

89
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,070
publication fee as you may have
found during open access. There

90
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,060
is no element of issues with
access they provide free access

91
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,170
there are not subscriptions or
paywalls, which means that you

92
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,850
can actually reach quite a wide
audience. A number of indexing

93
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,840
services such as Google Scholar
and EuropeanPMC, actually

94
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,770
include certain preprints that
also provides visibility and

95
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,490
PubMed also, it now is running a
pilot related to COVID-19

96
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,420
preprints. So you can reach a
wide audience, which is which

97
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,080
can also be useful in terms of
your work and gathering

98
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,010
attention for your study and
potentially attack more

99
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,040
citations, there's been a number
of studies that have looked at

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,250
the relationship between the
presence of a

101
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,940
preprint and the citations on
the dental journal publication

102
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,110
for the same work and they
consistently saw that one there

103
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,100
is a prior associated preprint.
For the for that work. The

104
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,370
actual journal publication
attracts more citation. So say

105
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,950
you've given a head start to
other people to build on

106
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,150
your work. And another element
that I wanted to mention that we

107
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,820
are very passionate about in
terms of preprint, this

108
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,390
element of allowing a
community feedback, you can get

109
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,240
the link of your preference,
right with all the others in

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,180
your community request comments
that you can use to again,

111
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,050
perhaps build on your work,
revise your paper, improve it.

112
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,910
And it can also be an
opportunity to open in

113
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,950
collaborations with all those
because there may be other

114
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,980
groups who are working in a
similar line of results as you

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,310
and you can get, they may
contact you after seeing your

116
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,540
your preprint. And as something
that has happened recently is

117
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,290
that journals have also taken
an interest in this. And some of

118
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,560
them have appointed editors who
say what's the latest papers

119
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,790
posted on preprint servers and
may even invite submission to

120
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,470
their journal. So you can
actually increase the

121
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,260
publication chances for your
event on your paper. And so I

122
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,920
wanted to spend a few minutes
giving a few tips in terms of

123
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,590
making the print print and
experience as positive as

124
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,560
possible. So just a few pointers
if you've decided to preprint

125
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,770
something a few of the things
that I would recommend thinking

126
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,450
about. The first one is to have
a little bit of a thinking as to

127
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,760
which preprint server you would
like to post your paper to the

128
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,060
preprint server ecosystem is
different from journals, and there is

129
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,530
no 1000s of
servers necessarily, but there's

130
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,550
been quite a few new platforms
that have launched over the last

131
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,790
few years. And now specifically
for the life sciences, which is

132
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,290
again where we work there are
around 50 servers available. So

133
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,800
as I have said, I recommand
you take a look at the ASAPbio

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,740
preprint server directory which
have a list of the different

135
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,250
platforms with characteristics
that you can check and compare

136
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,860
to fit your needs. There are a
few you know general-purpose

137
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,460
repositories that also take or lets say
apart from the fact that they

138
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,540
were set up to take mostly
datasets and their outputs,

139
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,140
they will also take a full
paper. So for example, Zenodo

140
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,960
and Figshare and they will
assign you a DOI as I said or

141
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,860
explained earlier. One thing to
consider, as you're thinking

142
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,280
where to post, obviously this is
your your choice. But one 

143
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,820
thing that can be useful is to
try to think about what elements

144
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,540
are important for you in and what
you want to get out of, again,

145
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,570
sharing your work as
preprint. One possible

146
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,830
consideration is visibility. The
different servers have different

147
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,690
communities associated with
them. So some pay more attention

148
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,630
to certain servers, etc. So you
may want to think which is the

149
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,440
best server to for your
audience, for your paper that

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,510
also some, for example, funders
on again, indexing services that

151
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,260
have certain criteria
recommendations for the service

152
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,050
that they recommend. So you may
want to take that into account

153
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,780
if that's something that is
relevant for your work in terms

154
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,500
of submitting to a server that
fits the requirements from your

155
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,980
funder.

156
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,950
And as you are again, preparing
to submit You should also think

157
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,730
if you are eventually thinking
of also submitting to a journal

158
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,290
check the journal policy on
preprint. The majority of the

159
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,440
journal in the life sciences
accept work that has been posted

160
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,440
as preprint but they may have
different policies in terms of

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,010
the type of preprint servers
that they accept or when they

162
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,830
are happy to see the paper
posted as a preprint compared to

163
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,970
the journal submission. So that's
something useful to check out.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,760
Add an important consideration
is also to think about the

165
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,420
license that you would like to
apply to your preprint. There

166
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,020
are a number of licenses
available, I list the resource

167
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,930
that we have on as a ASAPbio
related to the Creative Commons

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,240
licenses. One thing to remember
is that certain preprint areas

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,810
allow a variety of licenses you
can choose from while some

170
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,400
models actually restrict the
licenses. And actually, some all

171
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,240
will only post on the CC-BY so
something that you should check

172
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,740
prior to post them. Right. So
once you have made your choice

173
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,230
in terms of the servers, you
obviously so prepare your

174
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,160
manuscript, be as careful as you
will be one submit into a

175
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,690
journal, perhaps even more. But
one important element is of

176
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,780
course, it and this is the same
as when you submit to a journal,

177
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,570
they usually have all of the all
authors on board with pre printed

178
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,360
so make sure that you have that
conversation with your co

179
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,030
authors where again, we have a
number of resources on the ace

180
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,630
of ASAPbio website that can help
with some of those conversations

181
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,790
or some questions that people
may have about preprint. And

182
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,400
then obviously, we very much
support open science so we

183
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,090
recommend that you take steps to
also sell the data reagents or

184
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,550
tools that we've been just
discussing in the earlier

185
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,340
exercise you can add links to
that to your preprint so that

186
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,940
the preprint can again be
available for for anyone

187
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,110
interested in your paper in your
work to also find the associated

188
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,820
outputs. Right. So once you have
done all of that, obviously go

189
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,600
ahead and post the preprint
will be available again either

190
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,310
immediately if there is no prior
screening prior to posting or

191
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,180
yes in a matter of days and then
we very much say yes to a result

192
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,280
of that they take the
opportunity to encourage

193
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,670
feedback and and so their work
with us on social media or email

194
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,640
again try to kind of create the
bottom of the prepared and a

195
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,710
conversation going about your
work. And with that, I wanted to

196
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,530
stop there and you have my
contact details there and on the

197
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,830
on the agenda document or and I
also included here the link the

198
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,800
link to for the a survey
communities. Would you be

199
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,490
interested in joining us with
some resources and we exchange

200
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,610
ideas about preprints they also
You're very welcome to join us.

201
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,570
Thank you so much.
