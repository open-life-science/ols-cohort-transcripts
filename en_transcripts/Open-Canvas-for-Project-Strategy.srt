1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
Yo Yehudi: I'm going to talk a bit
about one tool that we like to

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,660
use at the very start of the
open life science cohorts, which

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,740
is the open canvas. And so if
I'm on the right window, I'm

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,930
going to talk about it. Now,
we're going to ask you to follow

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,350
up after the call, because it
takes a little while to spend

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,870
some time thinking about it. But
we'll walk through what it is

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,520
and why it might be useful, just
right now. So just going back

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,580
also to the Mozilla's open
leadership framework, this is

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,890
just to remind us, we're
focusing really specifically on

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,530
the design elements. If you
recall Malvika was talking

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,800
about how important it is to
design conscious pathways for

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,890
people to contribute and to be
involved in your open science

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,320
and community projects. So here,
we're looking really

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,600
specifically at what we can do
to design these pathways. And

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,570
this rubric, again, is something
we'll see quite often as we're

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,130
working through, ols. And so
this time, we're talking about

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,160
ways that we can find our
projects to empower

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,640
understanding, sharing, and
participation and inclusion

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,480
really specifically, I'm not
going to focus too much time on

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,280
this. But it is really
interesting to look through the

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,030
open leadership framework when
you have a minute or two. So

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,240
this is the open canvas and you
say, Oh, no, it's a form filling

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,260
exercise. It is. But it's really
useful one because it really

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,340
helps you to reflect on what
you're doing and where you're

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,300
going and why. So we're going to
actually drill in what each of

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,310
these little boxes means and why
they're useful. So we have some

27
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,890
sort of examples here. So you
can refer back to these slides.

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,380
And it sort of gives you some
hints about how you might want

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,410
to fill it out. But I'm going to
skip forward a little bit and

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,440
just talk about each of the
boxes individually, and why we

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,410
care and why we think they're
useful. So first of all, we've

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,470
divided this into two halves.
One is on the left, there's the

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,230
product. And on the right there
is the community. So one is

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,960
really about the thing that
you're offering. And the other

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,720
side, we're talking more about
the people who you're involving,

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,810
when you're doing this, because
it's never really just about the

37
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,750
project that you're working on.
It's also always about the

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,550
people that you're working with
as much as anything. So digging

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,990
into box number one, the
problem. So just, if you can

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,720
print this out, print it if
otherwise, bring it up on Google

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,300
Slides or fill this out on your
computer, but try and write down

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,910
when you're doing your project,
what is the problem that you're

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,260
trying to solve? So for ols, for
example, the problem that we are

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,680
trying to solve might be that
open science is not something

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,310
that is well known. And it's not
something that's easy. You can't

46
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,280
just bring it fully formed  and not know
how to show share your work in

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,200
an effective way. And then if we
move on to the next thing, what

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,260
is then your proposed solution?
So you know, you know you have a

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,140
problem? How would you like to
fix it? In our case, this was

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,010
run a 16 week mentorship program
to help people learn a bit more

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,710
and spread the word to others as
well. And then, how will you

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,040
know that what you're doing is
something that is successful. So

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,850
what are your key metrics for
this? So once again, for lls

54
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,490
this might be and doesn't have
to be one example could be OLS is

55
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,820
the number of people who have
participated in the program. So

56
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,600
in OLS2, we had about 20
projects, and in our OLS3,

57
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,040
we have almost 40 projects and
over 60 participants. So this is

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,890
a metric that shows us that we
are in fact being successful and

59
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,270
spreading the word. And then now
that you've got an idea of what

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,570
you want to do, and how you want
to measure it, the next question

61
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,010
is what resources do you need to
build this and this could be I

62
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,060
need somewhere to put a website,
it could be I need people that

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,880
are you know, I need their brain
power. Or maybe I need a coder,

64
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,610
maybe I need someone who's a
community manager to help me

65
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,970
out. Or maybe I want a designer,
there are so many different

66
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,130
things that you might need. And
it really depends on your

67
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,730
project. But just try and think
if you want to get the basics,

68
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,120
just the real kickoff, what what
resources do you need to

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,070
assemble to get there. And now
we actually move on to the

70
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,740
community side where we start
thinking more about those people

71
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,760
because one of those resources
may in fact, be the people. And

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,640
so if you had someone who's
contributing to your project,

73
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,120
think about who they are and
what they might look like. So

74
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,870
again, if I'm thinking about
OLS, for example, then some

75
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,110
of our contributions might be
open science practitioners who

76
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,960
are our mentors and our experts,
and they can actually give

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,770
advice to other people. I'm
going to skip this box and move

78
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,360
on to user profiles. So the
target audience so who do we

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,330
want to be using this? So if
you're thinking about your

80
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,030
project, and this is something
that you're building so that

81
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,190
other people can use it and
participate that's slightly

82
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,410
different from contributors,
because contributors are the

83
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,500
people who help you build this
users of people actually use

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,970
what you've built. And so for
OLS, the user profile would be

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,820
many of you who are here
participating as the project

86
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,340
leads and the mentees. And then
you start thinking a bit about

87
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,220
the channels. So now that we
know who the people we want to

88
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,760
work with are we say, Well, how
can we gain them? So for

89
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,540
example, for us to get
contributors for OLS, a lot

90
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,880
of the time our channel was
simply email, we used our

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,230
personal networks, and we said,
Hey, lovely person who we think

92
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,980
you can be a mentor, can you
participate? Another one might

93
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,790
be Twitter, for example, if you
share on social media, there may

94
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,700
be other ways depending on what
your community is, it might be

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,580
that you're reaching out to
someone local to you, or a

96
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,430
research network or something
else like that. But that was

97
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,980
previously for contributed
channels. This is again, the

98
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,870
these are the people who are
helping you build what you

99
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,750
build. And now we're thinking
how can what channels do we use

100
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,660
if we want to find people who
want to learn from what we

101
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,210
build, who want to participate,
but not necessarily as a

102
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,400
contribution. So gaining new
users, for OLS, I think a lot

103
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,450
of us has been word of mouth,
for example. But also people who

104
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,240
have participated have been
shared it within their networks.

105
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,220
And we've done things like
podcasts, and we've done talks,

106
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,800
and we've done blog posts, and
we've done social media to try

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,620
and gain the new users as the
new project leads and the new

108
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,790
mentees. So have a think about
what your user channels are and

109
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,810
how you'd get gain new users.
And this is the community

110
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,360
engagement sort of subset of
boxes. And finally, now that

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,630
you've thought about all of
these things, think, what is the

112
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,010
clear message to state what you
offer? What Why do people wants

113
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,700
to come to you what what is the
catch the exciting thing, and

114
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,390
this might be perhaps, restating
your problem and solution, but

115
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,550
in a short and concise sentence,
and also just explaining why

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,630
you're different to others. So I
tried to think what this will be

117
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,010
for OLS. Probably something
about the fact that we are

118
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,220
experienced Open Science
practitioners who have been

119
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,300
working with community for
collaboratively for quite a long

120
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,200
time. And that we are able to
teach this and passes on to

121
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,690
other people. But again, try and
think about what this might mean

122
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,880
for your project as well. And so
here is an example of one that's

123
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
been filled out with a project
in mind where people will get

124
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,660
badges for working on open
science. So it gives you a bit

125
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,780
more of an idea about what it
might look tangibly with when

126
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,680
it's been applied to a project.
Again, this the link to the

127
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,280
slides is available on the notes
documents, you can go back to

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,610
this and you can view it
yourself in your own time. And

129
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,840
we also have a link so that you
can write your own open canvas

130
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,480
and I think this is one of our
assignments for the week, which

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,480
is so it's bit dot L y slash o
LS dash open dash canvas.
